    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "## Decision Trees \n",
    "1) An example for real-world application might be predicting whether or not a borrower is able to pay off personal loans based on credit history, income, and other available background infromation. This help banks and peer-to-peer lending companies (such as lending club) to identify good investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Decision trees tends to perform well on data with balanced classes, and when there is good understanding on features and why some features are importance differentiating the target classes (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Pros: \n",
    "   - Decision trees are easy to interpret, and can be visualized. \n",
    "   - It is computationally fast, and scalable to large N. \n",
    "   - Naturally handle mixture of categorical and numerical data.\n",
    "   - Insensitive to outliers, and able to handle missing data.\n",
    "   - Robust to violation of assumptions by true model from which data are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Decision trees are not suitable for datasets with unbalanced classes (Pedregosa et al., 2011).  Decision trees tend to overfit on data with a large number of features.  Cons: \n",
    "   - cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple   \n",
    "     trees in an ensemble learner.\n",
    "   - Generate biased tree if samples are unbalanced. \n",
    "   - Sometimes generate over-complex trees. Need to control minimum number of samples required at a splitting node\n",
    "     or max depth to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "   - Unstable, again training trees within ensemble can mitigate this problem.       \n",
    "   - Does not have a probability interpretation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4) Because the datasets has a mixture of categorical and numerical data. Some of the features seem informative to differentiate individuals' income classes (e.g capital gain, working hours per week etc.). In addition '>50K' class makes up 25% of the training examples, so it is not terribly unbalanced.  Considering decision tree is also fast to train and make predictions, it can be a good base learner for such dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensemble Methods - Random forest (rf)  \n",
    "1) Among ensemble methods, bagging and boosting have similar performance on many problems. Taking rf (substantially modified bagging) for example, such model can be applied to predict whether a high-school graduate is able to go to college based on his/her academic performance, as well as school and family characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) pros (Hastie et al., 2008):\n",
    "   - Individual tree model tends to have high variance and low bias, it benifit greatly from averaging: in \n",
    "     particular rf generated multiple un-correlated trees (by using randomized subsets of features and boostrapped \n",
    "     training examples) and average them, thus reduce model variance. \n",
    "   - Like decision tree, rf has the similar advantages of handling mixture of categorical and continous data, \n",
    "     scalable to large N, insensitive to outliers.\n",
    "   - Tuning is relatively easy (e.g. test error rate gets stable around a couple of hundreds trees)\n",
    "   - Output feature importance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3) cons (Hastie et al., 2008):\n",
    "   - When the number of predictor is large, but the fraction of relevant variables are small, random forests are \n",
    "     likely to perform poorly with small subset of features.  \n",
    "     \n",
    "4) Firstly data type is suitable for tree-based models. The size of feature space (~ 100), as well as sample size (training data size ~ 40000) should be able to train deep enough trees (to have low bias) and reduce variance by averaging. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "1) SVM with kernal function can be used for text classification problems. For instance to classify short on-line  \n",
    "   onversations into different action classes such as 'friendly/unfriendly/neutral', or 'anoucement/Q&A/negative'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Perform well on small to medium size of training examples, and low noise datasets. It is also considered as a panelized method. Pros:\n",
    "   - High predictin power.\n",
    "   - Guarantee to return the globle optimal.\n",
    "   - Able to extract linear combination of features. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Tends to perform poorly on noisy (e.g. overlapping-classes) and large size of datasets. Cons:\n",
    "   - Sensitive to kernal functions. \n",
    "   - Hard to scale to dataset with more than a couple of 10000 samples (Hastie et al., 2008: pp. 350-352).\n",
    "   - Not well handle mixture of numerical and categorical features (calculating distance metrics can be  \n",
    "     complicated).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4) After transformation and normalization, the number of features is still suitable for a SVM.\n",

    "The most appropriate model identifying individuals of >50K income would be random forest. Regarding F score on testing set, SVM and random forest output better result than decision tree.  Although both SVM and random forest generate similar F scores on text set when 100% of training data is used, SVM has much longer run (training/prediction) time. For instances, it takes near 24 seconds to training a SVM model while only takes about 0.03 seconds for random forest). Moreover random forest gains very good F score on training set, it suggests that parameters can to be tuned to mitigate overfitting problem, and importantly there is quite a bit of space to improve the model performance (most likely to be able to decrease training score but increase testing score on random forest). \n",
    "Random forest models bootstap both training examples and training features, and average the results among many sub-trees.  Such ensemble methods effectively reduce model variance. Random forest models, like other tree-based models, natually support a mixture of numerical and categorical features, therefore it is suitable to be applied to this learning problem. "

    "\n",
    "   Bagging or boostrap aggregation is a technique for reducing variance of an estimated prediction function. Random forests (rf) is a highly modified bagging method. The main advantage of rf is that it effectively reduce variance by generating many un-correlated, low-bias (potentially high variance) trees and averaging among them to make final prediction. The idea in rf is to improve the overall variance reduction of bagging by reducing the correlation between the trees, without increasing the variance from individual tree too much.  Key parameters to tune in a rf model are 1) number of trees from which final prediction is an averaging, and 2) tree depth meaning how complicated and how deep the splits can go.  Alternative for tuning tree depth is to tune minimum number of examples kept at leaf nodes, and notice that the smaller this number is, the deeper the tree grows (Hastie et al., 2008, pp 587 - 602).\n",
    "\n",
    "   So why how does rf generated un-correlated trees (with contrast boosting methods generate sequencely related trees to reduce bias) and what the advantage. Because of the way rf works: it firstly randomly draws a subset of samples from the full training set with replacement (bootstrap), and then randomly draws a subset of features from the full set of features, and picks the best variable among the subset of features to split the node into two daughter nodes; the splits grows until maximum tree depth is reached. Because each split is based on a random subset of features, and each tree is a bootstrapped sample, individual trees built from this process will be independent from each other.  The lower the correlation among trees, the more overall variance will be reduced after averaging.  Due to the splitting process, number of sub-features is also important, while not as sensitive as the other two parameters.  In order to tune the hyper-parameters (number of trees, and maximum depth) for an optimal model, grid search with cross-validation is applied.  The training set is randomly split to several proportions (k), and this technique is called k-fold cross-validation.  Each combination of parameters will be trained on the k-1 folds of data and tested on the rest one fold.  This process will be done for each of the k folds (a total of k times), and the optimal parameter estimate will be picked based on the average test error among the k folds.  When the optimal parameters are fixed, rf with such hyper-parameters is fit to training set.  Final prediction is made based on the vote of predictions from individual trees, or averaging their probabilistic prediction (in sk-learn). \n",

    "I would think age, working hours per week, captical gain, eduction level and relationship in family are most informative predictors for individual income. \n",
    "- Age: usually annual income of a person is fairly low in younger age, and reach highest in middle age (30s-50s), and when a person gets older, income will decline due to retirement, medical cost, etc. As the plot shows, majority of higher income come from 30s, 40s and 50s; while 20s-30s make up large proportion of lower income class.\n",
    "- Working hours per week: full time workers should on average earns more than part-time works, longer working time makes a person earn more holding other conditions the same (this is also supported by the plot).\n",
    "- Capital gain: middle- and upper-middle class family generally have healthy, sustainable investment (e.g. stocks, high interest saving etc.) hence good capital gains. \n",
    "- Relationship (similar and correlated with marriage status): stable husband and wife relationship while husband is the main income source seems correlate with good income, while in lower income class family relationship tends to be more diverse.\n",
    "- Education level: based on the proportion of different eduction levels in the two income classes, college, high school grads, master above degree owners is the major proportion of high income class; with contrast master above degree owners is less common in lower income class."

    "My thought are close on capital gain, age, and family relationship. I did not realize the marriage status and education number (years of education completed) instead of education level are good predictors of income most or above 50K. As the plot has shown, captical gain and being in a husband-wife marriage are the most important predictors of income classes, followed by being the husband in the family and education number, then age. \n",
    "\n",
    "I guess marriage status is not only indicate the stable family relationship, it also correlated with age and social-economic status. It is interesting that being the husband in the family is a strong predictor; nevertheless this is also expected since home-maker or part-time-job moms are very common in the US. It turns out years of education completed is more direct or informative feature than education level. This is probably because that education level is a nominal categorical variable, when transformed with one hot vector (to 16 different status), the variation among those status are not sufficient to differentiate the income classes. For a instance the income of individuals having some college education may not be that different from master degree owners. With contrast education number is a continuous variable, and has probably better captured the variation in income classes."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The final model's F-score and accuracy score on five-top-features' model is 0.8352 and 0.6923 compared to original optimal model at 0.8594 and 0.7325. Although the training is twice faster (4.0 seconds compared to 8.0 seconds), the F-score has a substaintial drop. I also fit the model on top 10, 15 and 20 features. Based on the results on testing scores as well as training time, 10 or 15 features generate reasonably good results (accuracy ~85% and F-score ~ 0.73) with apparently shorter training time (4.7 seconds compared to 8.0 seconds in full model). Therefore I would consider to use the reduced data with 10 or 15 features.   "
